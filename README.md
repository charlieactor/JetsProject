# Charlie Actor's Jets project
## Second-Week Graded Project

This is my week 2 graded project. I opted to make everything Star Wars themed because everything is better when it's Star Wars themed (especially flying things).
* User menu now has 7 options to allow user to hire pilots and view all pilots
* Pilots are assigned to ships randomly from the Barracks array of pilots.
* Otherwise this should be fairly self-explanatory! Enjoy creating and manipulating the jets/pilots that can save our galaxy from the evil empire! Unless you're of the mind that the empire did nothing wrong, in which case feel free to create Darth Vader Pilots, Adam Driver pilots, and so on.
